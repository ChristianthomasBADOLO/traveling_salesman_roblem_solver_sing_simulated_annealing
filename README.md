# Traveling salesman problem solver sing Simulated Annealing

 This project aims to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Simulated Annealing, an optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. The TSP involves finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city. Simulated Annealing is used to explore and optimize the solution space efficiently.

## The process

1. Generating Town Configurations: Generating random town configurations, including square![square](results/image.png), gaussian![Gaussian](results/image-1.png), circle![Circle](results/image-2.png), and infinite![infinite](results/image-3.png) configurations. Each configuration provides a different layout of towns, contributing to a diverse exploration of the solution space.

2. Algorithm Development: After generating these configurations, I developed the Simulated Annealing algorithm. This algorithm is designed to optimize the route for the Traveling Salesman Problem by iteratively exploring and adjusting the route based on temperature functions and acceptance probabilities."
